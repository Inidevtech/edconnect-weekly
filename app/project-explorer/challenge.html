              <h2>My Background and Personality!</h2>
            <p>My name is <strong>Tunde-Idowu Inioluwa</strong>, 17years old. I am a young girl from Lagos state, Nigeria.<br>
                I come from a christian home. I am a very positive person towards every aspect of life, I try to see the good in life<br>
                 and have faith that it's all for the best.
            </p>
            <p>I enjoy watching football, <i>a Real Madrid fan</i>, , watching interesting videos, generally having fun and very easily drawn<br>
                 to tech stuff and I hope to really know it. 
            I like listening to music, <i>I never go around without my earphones</i>.<br>
             I like to learn, I don't like much work but I'm beginning to
             because of my interest in technology. As a child, I wanted to be a pastor,<br> then a lecturer in a higher institution , then a paediatric neurosurgeon; I read alot of Ben Carson.<br>
             Now!, I just want to become a very successful person in my field. I might not be the brain behind a big innovation like <b>Bill Gates or Vint Cerf.</b><br>
             I hope to be like the important people behind the functionality of an innovation, I hope to understand everything I need to know and be known for it.
             </p>
            <p>I am quiet atimes, with the right company I am very jolly and outspoken. I am decent, smart, nice and forgiving which some people tend to take for granted.<br>
                With that, I still try keep a positive mindset.
                 I was brought up to always aim for the best, So help me God.
                <br>
                I hope to get really rich because I have an agenda to help people alot and it involves money and the grace of God, thats basically what everyone needs.
